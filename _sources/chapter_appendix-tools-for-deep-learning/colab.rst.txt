Using Google Colab
==================


We introduced how to run this book on AWS in :numref:`sec_sagemaker`
and :numref:`sec_aws`. Another option is running this book on `Google
Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`__ if you have a Google
account.

To run the code of a section on Colab, simply click the ``Colab`` button
as shown in :numref:`fig_colab`.

.. _fig_colab:

.. figure:: ../img/colab.png
   :width: 300px

   Run the code of a section on Colab.



If it is your first time to run a code cell, you will receive a warning
message as shown in :numref:`fig_colab2`. Just click “RUN ANYWAY” to
ignore it.

.. _fig_colab2:

.. figure:: ../img/colab-2.png
   :width: 300px

   Ignore the warning message by clicking “RUN ANYWAY”.



Next, Colab will connect you to an instance to run the code of this
section. Specifically, if a GPU is needed, Colab will be automatically
requested for connecting to a GPU instance.

Summary
-------

-  You can use Google Colab to run each section’s code in this book.
-  Colab will be requested to connect to a GPU instance if a GPU is
   needed in any section of this book.

Exercises
---------

1. Open any section of this book using Google Colab.
2. Edit and run any section that requires a GPU using Google Colab.
